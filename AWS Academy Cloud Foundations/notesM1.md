# Module 1

## Intro to Cloud

On-demand, as in when you want it. Pay-as-you-go pricing. 

Turning infrastructure into software. Hardware hard to maintain, software flexible to use.

Type of cloud service:

- IaaS: using networked hardware directly on its OS, storage, etc.

- PaaS: front for services easily interconnected, focuses on deploying solutions

- SaaS: product templates just customized, managed-by-providers applications, think only about the end-user product

Type of deployment:

* Raw Cloud: all cloud, all flexibility

* Hybrid: extend on-premises to cloud

* On-premises: local virtualization (instance) of cloud

Most IT has independent AWS services equivalents

## Advantages

Variable cost, no need for investment or set-asides beforehand. Pay-as-you-go. No wasting tech power, no wasting money. Increase speed of access to infrastructure turns to increase in agility. Go global.

## Intro to AWS

Services communicating with APIs to your own development. Built as REST-like.

Multiple categories of services: compute, ar&vr, iot, etc.

One or many services inside each category

A solution is comprised of multiple services interconnected. A VPC (service) hosting an EC2 connected to a DynamoDB and an Amazon S3.

Connect via AWS console (platform) or CLI or SDKs.

## Moving to AWS

AWS Cloud Adoption Framework: Series of documentation and information tailored to different areas inside a business to accelerate migration.

## Quiz

Economies of scale represent when by having more customers and power to produce, the cost of your product reduces. In AWS, with more clients and hardware, the cloud services become cheaper, contrary to on-premises hardware.
